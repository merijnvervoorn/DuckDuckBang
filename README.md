Bangs Search is a GNOME Shell extension that allows you to quickly search using !bangs from your GNOME search. It is inspired by DuckDuckGo's !bangs feature.

## Usage

To use Bangs Search, simply type `!` followed by the bang command you want to use in the GNOME search bar. For example, to search for `!w` in Wikipedia, type `!w GNOME` or for google search, type `!g GNOME`.

### Pro Tip

Use it with the `Super` key to quickly search for anything on the web. Alternatively, use the Searchlight extension to assign a keyboard shortcut to open the search bar and then type `!` followed by the bang command. Trust me, it's faster than opening a browser and typing the search query.
